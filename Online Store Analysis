https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylermorse/retail-business-sales-20172019/data

I've created sql lite data set and imported the tables into it.

#1 Calculating the total of net sales: 

select round(sum("Total Net Sales"), 2) as profit 
from productsales; 

2# Calculating the average of the net sales: 

select round(avg("Total Net Sales"),2) as AVG_Sales
from productsales;  

3# Calculating the total amount of discounts applied: 

select round(sum(Discounts),2) as Total_Discounts 
from productsales; 

4# Calculating the average of the discounts applied: 

select round(avg(Discounts),2) as AVG_Discounts
from productsales;  

5# Calculating the total amount of returns grouped by the product type: 

select "Product Type", 
round(sum(Returns),2) as "Total Returns"
from productsales
where "Product Type" <> ''
Group By "Product Type";

6# Creating a table with the product type, total of items sold, and the total net sales for each type of product: 

Select "Product Type",
sum("Net Quantity") as Total_Items,
round(sum("Total Net Sales"),2) as Total_Sales
from productsales 
where "Product Type" <> ''
group by "Product Type"; 

7# Calculating the number of orders, the total amount of discounts, the value of returns, and the total of net sales grouped by the year: 

select Year, 
"Total Orders", 
round(sum("Discounts"),1) as "Discounts",
round(sum("Returns"),1) as "Returns",
round(sum("Net Sales"),1) as "Net Sales"
from monthsales 
group by Year;  

8# Identifying the month with the best performance for each year: 

Select Year, 
Month,
"Total Orders", 
Round(MAX("Net Sales"),2) as "Total Sales"
from monthsales 
group by Year;  

9# Identifying the month with the lowest performance for each year: 

Select Year, 
Month, 
"Total Orders", 
Round(MIN("Net Sales"),2) as "Total Sales"
from monthsales 
group by Year;
