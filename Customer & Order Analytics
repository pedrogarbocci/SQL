#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'; 


#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'; 


#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers as cust 

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb 
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'OrderID'; 


#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales); 


#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT ROUND(SUM((Quantity * price)),2) as Revenue,product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product;  


#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity) as quantity_tot, product, 
ROUND(SUM((Quantity*price)),2) as revenue, 
location 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY product; 


#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) as dist_clients, 
ROUND(avg(quantity * price),2) as avg_spent 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers as cust 
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id 
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';
