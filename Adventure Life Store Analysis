# This project utilizes the following data: 

https://github.com/bcafferky/shared/blob/master/PythonSQLite/PythonSQLite.zip

I've created sql lite data set and imported the tables into it. 

#1 Consolidate a table with customer full's name, product key, sales territory, sales amount, and order date using the intersales table and the dimcustomer table:Â  

select 
d.FirstName ||" "|| d.LastName as "Full Name",
i.ProductKey, 
i.SalesTerritoryKey, 
i.SalesAmount, 
i.OrderDate
from intersales as i
left join dimcustomer as d
on i.CustomerKey = d.CustomerKey; 

#2 Refining the previous table with the addition of the country and the description of the products using the following tables: awsalesterritory and the awproduct: 

select 
c."Full Name", 
w.ProductName as "Product",
c.SalesAmount, 
a.SalesTerritoryCountry as "Country",
c.OrderDate

from consales as c 
Left Join awsalesterritory as a 
on c.SalesTerritoryKey = a.SalesTerritoryKey
Left join awproduct as w 
on c.productkey = w.productkey; 

I've exported the results into a CSV table and then imported it to the Tableau public and created the following data visualization and analysis:
