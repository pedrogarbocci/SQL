# This project utilizes the following data: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samruddhi4040/online-sales-data 

I've created sql lite data set and imported the tables into it. 

#1 Calculating the total of orders: 

Select Count(distinct("Order ID")) as "Total Orders"
from details;  

#2 Calculating the profit: 

select round(sum(Profit), 2) as "Total Profit"
from details;  

#3 Calculating the profit per category of product: 

select 
Category,
round(sum(Profit),2) as "Total Profit"
from details 
group by Category;  

#4 Calculating the total of items sold:

select 
sum(Quantity) as "Total Items Sold"
from details; 

#5 Calculating the total of items sold per category:

select 
Category,
sum(Quantity) as "Total Items Sold" 
from details
group by Category; 

#6 Calculating the total of customers:

select 
count(distinct(CustomerName)) as "Total of Clients"
from orders; 

#7 Calculating the profit for each payment mode: 

select "PaymentMode", 
round(sum(Profit),2) as "Total Profit"
from details
group by "PaymentMode";

#8 Calculating the total loss for each category:

Select 
Category,
round(sum(Profit),2) as "Loss"
from details
where Profit like '-%'
group by Category; 

#9 Merging the two tables into one with relevant informations to do the executive dashbord overview in tableau: 

select d."Order Id", 
o."Order Date" as "Order Date", 
o."CustomerName" as "Customer Name", 
o.State as "State",
d.Amount as "Gross Sales",
d.Profit as "Profit",
d.Quantity as "Quantity",
d.Category as "Category",
d."Sub-Category" as "Sub Category",
d."PaymentMode" as "Payment Mode"
from details as d 
Left Join orders as o
where d."Order ID" = o."Order ID";
